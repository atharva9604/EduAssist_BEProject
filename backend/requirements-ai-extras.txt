# Optional / Experimental AI dependencies
#
# Install ONLY if you explicitly use the CrewAI-based modules in `backend/crewAI/`.
# These dependencies are intentionally separated to avoid pip resolver conflicts
# and huge transitive installs when they are not needed.
#
# Usage:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-ai-extras.txt
#
sentence-transformers>=2.2.2,<3.0.0
crewai==0.28.8
